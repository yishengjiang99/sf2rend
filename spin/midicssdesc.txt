MIDI CC 1 Modulation Wheel (MSB) 0-127 Generally this CC controls a vibrato effect (pitch, loudness,
brighness). What is modulated is based on the patch.
MIDI CC 2 Breath Controller (MSB) 0-127 Often times associated with aftertouch messages. It was
originally intended for use with a breath MIDI controller in
which blowing harder produced higher MIDI control values. It
can be used for modulation as well.
MIDI CC 3 Undefined (MSB) 0-127
MIDI CC 4 Foot Pedal (MSB) 0-127 Often used with aftertouch messages. It can send a continuous
stream of values based on how the pedal is used.
MIDI CC 5 Portamento Time (MSB) 0-127 Controls portamento rate to slide between 2 notes played
subsequently.
MIDI CC 6 Data Entry (MSB) 0-127 Controls Value for NRPN or RPN parameters.
MIDI CC 7 Volume (MSB) 0-127 Controls the volume of the channel.
MIDI CC 8 Balance (MSB) 0-127 Controls the left and right balance, generally for stereo patches.
A value of 64 equals the center.
MIDI CC 9 Undefined (MSB) 0-127
MIDI CC 10 Pan (MSB) 0-127 Controls the left and right balance, generally for mono patches.
A value of 64 equals the center.
MIDI CC 11 Expression (MSB) 0-127 Expression is a percentage of volume (CC7).
MIDI CC 12 Effect Controller 1 (MSB) 0-127 Usually used to control a parameter of an effect within the synth
or workstation.
MIDI CC 13 Effect Controller 2 (MSB) 0-127 Usually used to control a parameter of an effect within the synth
or workstation.
MIDI CC 14 Undefined (MSB) 0-127
MIDI CC 15 Undefined (MSB) 0-127
MIDI CC 16 – 19 General Purpose (MSB) 0-127
MIDI CC 20 – 31 Undefined (MSB) 0-127
MIDI CC 32 – 63 LSB Controller for 0-31 0-127
MIDI CC 64 Damper Pedal on/off ≤63 off, ≥64 on On/off switch that controls sustain pedal. Nearly every synth
will react to CC 64. (See also Sostenuto CC 66)
MIDI CC 65 Portamento on/off ≤63 off, ≥64 on On/off switch
MIDI CC 66 Sostenuto Pedal on/off ≤63 off, ≥64 on On/off switch – Like the Sustain controller (CC 64), However, it
only holds notes that were “On” when the pedal was pressed.
People use it to “hold” chords” and play melodies over the held
chord.
MIDI CC 67 Soft Pedal on/off ≤63 off, ≥64 on On/off switch – Lowers the volume of notes played.
MIDI CC 68 Legato FootSwitch ≤63 off, ≥64 on On/off switch – Turns Legato effect between 2 subsequent notes
on or off.
MIDI CC 69 Hold 2 ≤63 off, ≥64 on Another way to “hold notes” (see MIDI CC 64 and MIDI CC 66).
However notes fade out according to their release parameter
rather than when the pedal is released.
MIDI CC 70 Sound Controller 1 0-127 Usually controls the way a sound is produced. Default = Sound
Variation.
MIDI CC 71 Sound Controller 2 0-127 Allows shaping the Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF). Default
= Resonance also (Timbre or Harmonics)
MIDI CC 72 Sound Controller 3 0-127 Controls release time of the Voltage controlled Amplifier (VCA).
Default = Release Time.
MIDI CC 73 Sound Controller 4 0-127 Controls the “Attack’ of a sound. The attack is the amount of
time it takes forthe sound to reach maximum amplitude.
MIDI CC 74 Sound Controller 5 0-127 Controls VCFs cutoff frequency of the filter.

MIDI CC 120 to 127 are “Channel Mode Messages.”
MIDI CC 120 All Sound Off 0 Mutes all sound. It does so regardless of release time or sustain.
(See MIDI CC 123)
MIDI CC 121 Reset All Controllers 0 It will reset all controllers to their default.
MIDI CC 122 Local on/off Switch 0 off, 127 on Turns internal connection of a MIDI keyboard or workstation,
etc. on or off. If you use a computer, you will most likely want
local control off to avoid notes being played twice. Once locally
and twice when the note is sent back from the computer to your
keyboard.
MIDI CC 123 All Notes Off 0 Mutes all sounding notes. Release time will still be maintained,
and notes held by sustain will not turn off until sustain pedal is
depressed.
MIDI CC 124 Omni Mode Off 0 Sets to “Omni Off” mode.
MIDI CC 125 Omni Mode On 0 Sets to “Omni On” mode.
MIDI CC 126 Mono Mode → Sets device mode to Monophonic. The value equals the number
of channels, or 0 if the number of channels equals the number of
voices in the receiver.
MIDI CC 127 Poly Mode 0 Sets device mode to Polyphonic.
